When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Whenever there is a need for multiple people to access the work, or anytime that you want to have it backed up so if your local computer 
breaks you can still access it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Some things you are updating on your computer you don't want to add to the overall project until you're sure they work and won't mess up other stuff.
